*“To truly transform a city, we must democratize every kind of capital—financial, intellectual, social, and experiential—empowering communities to regenerate not just ecosystems, but entire ways of living.”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

Lisbon—where old-world charm coexists with a world-class tech scene—was the perfect seedbed for ReFi Lisboa. Officially launched in February 2023, it took root under the vision of co-founders who saw Lisbon’s unique fusion of creativity, culture, and collaboration as a launchpad for the regenerative finance movement. Inspired by the city’s innovators, underrepresented voices, and community-driven spirit, ReFi Lisboa set out to make “ReFi” more than a buzzword. Their aim: build a movement that demystifies regenerative finance and weaves it into the city’s everyday rhythms. By nurturing local talent and tapping into Lisbon’s global flair, the node strives to translate big regenerative ideas into tangible impact on the ground.

### **What Makes ReFi Lisboa Special**

ReFi Lisboa is a living bridge between the historical pulse of Lisbon and the cutting edge of Web3 innovation. It’s a space where old café chatter collides with new blockchain ideas, and where the ReFi ethos embraces artists, tech entrepreneurs, refugees, and grassroots changemakers alike. By infusing local traditions—like open-air gatherings and neighborly storytelling—into futuristic tech experiments, ReFi Lisboa proves that regeneration isn’t just a concept; it’s a way of life that can unite a deeply diverse community in crafting more sustainable, inclusive futures.
