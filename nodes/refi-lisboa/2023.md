ReFi Day @ Poolside Hub Opening Event

## 2023 Highlights

- **Successful Event Series and Community Growth**: Kicked off with a successful inaugural event in February, which laid the foundation for a strong community base for ReFi Lisboa, followed by consistent monthly events throughout the year, culminating in [**ReFi Week**](https://blog.refidao.com/regeneration-at-refi-week/) at the Traditional Dream Factory and a unifying Christmas party that brought together various Web3 communities.
- **Threefold Events for Ecosystem Mapping**: Organized a series of three events aimed at mapping the regenerative ecosystem in Portugal and leading to the creation of an MVP online map. This map facilitates connections and guides travelers to regenerative environments in and around cities, expanding the reach to other nodes.
- **Portuguese** **Podcast Launch**: Launched [**planta-R](https://twitter.com/podplanta_r),** a new ReFi Podcast in Portugeese. Extending beyond Portugal, this also aims to include Brazil, Mozambique, and a diverse array of Portuguese-speaking countries.

**Vision & Plans for 2024**

- **Diversification and Expansion**: Planning to diversify activities beyond monthly events. This includes community actions like beach clean-ups, collaborations with organizations, and thematic tracks such as technology and self-regeneration.
- **Experimentation with Event Formats**: Exploring different formats, not just traditional speaking events, but also engaging workshops and interactive sessions, reflecting a year of experimentation and growth.
- **Community Growth**: Aiming to expand the community further, integrating them into the ReFi Lisboa network.
