*“Barcelona’s culture of alternative economies and solidarity systems makes it the perfect testing ground for regenerative finance”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

ReFi Barcelona was born from the alignment of Barcelona’s eco-social values with the ReFi movement. Luiz Fernando recognised that the city and region’s history of organising alternative economies—such as the social and solidarity economy (SSE) and alternative economies—offered fertile ground for showcasing how ReFi principles could amplify these efforts.

The node’s goal is to serve as a bridge between the global ReFi ecosystem and local needs, connecting regenerative projects with resources, tools, and frameworks to ensure their long-term sustainability and scalability.

### **What Makes ReFi Barcelona Special**

ReFi Barcelona stands out for its intentional alignment with **Catalonia’s cooperative culture** and alternative financial systems. By embedding Web3 concepts into a **cooperative model**, the node ensures accessibility, inclusivity, and adaptability for local regenerative projects.

Rather than starting from scratch, ReFi Barcelona integrates into existing communities, building trust and relationships with groups already engaged in **ecosocial transition**. This collaborative, ecosystem-based approach exemplifies the potential of ReFi to reinforce local impact while drawing from global resources.
