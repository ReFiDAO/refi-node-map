*“Twelve years ago, I envisioned a system that rewards regenerative activities. Today, with ReFi Bay Area, that vision is becoming a reality. By aligning architecture, real estate, and finance with regeneration, we’re creating a blueprint for thriving, sustainable communities.” Alvaro*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

ReFi Bay Area was born out of Alvaro Cabal’s deep-rooted commitment to sustainability and a journey that began 12 years ago with solar energy and self-sufficiency. After a spiritual awakening during COVID and reconnecting with architecture and permaculture, Alvaro discovered ReFi through the “Funding the Earth Commons” event in Berkeley. Inspired by the potential of regenerative finance and Web3, Alvaro aligned his vision with ReFi DAO, culminating in the official founding of ReFi Bay Area in August 2024 during the Regen Coordi-NATION round.

The node’s purpose is clear: to create tokenised systems that reward regenerative activities while incubating impactful projects. ReFi Bay Area aims to leverage architecture, real estate, and finance to create land-based initiatives that regenerate the planet and align financial success with ecological and social value.

### **What Makes ReFi Bay Area Special**

ReFi Bay Area’s unique blend of architecture, real estate, and finance sets it apart. By leveraging its expertise in land-based projects, the node is pioneering new models for urban and suburban regeneration. Key projects like **Urban House Farms**—integrating organic farms into urban properties and creating an on-chain food trading network—highlight the node’s innovative approach.

What truly distinguishes ReFi Bay Area is its focus on **high-ticket real estate and solar projects**. These projects not only generate revenue but also fund regenerative initiatives, creating a virtuous cycle of impact.
