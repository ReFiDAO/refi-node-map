    > “In 2015, after meeting Vitalik Buterin and joining the Thiel Foundation community, I recognized Web3 as my calling. In 2019, attending the Celo Prosper Retreat confirmed ReFi as my career goal. My dream is to be a digital product designer in a future-proofed company with a social impact mission.” - Tian-Yuan Zhao
