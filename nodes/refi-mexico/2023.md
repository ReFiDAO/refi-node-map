> "When we sat down with Paco and Pedro from Huerto Roma Verde, it was evident that their commitment was genuine. They welcomed the ideas of Web3 and sustainability with open arms. Their knowledge and experience were profound, and they recognized this as a global movement. It became clear that the initiatives we are pioneering in Mexico have the potential to reach and influence other parts of the world." - Oscar Andrade
