*“ReFi is about regenerating the social fabric while creating coordinated environmental frameworks and grassroots economics. It’s weaving passion into systems for real-world impact.”* 

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

ReFi Mexico emerged in March 2023 when Gerardo Alvarez and Oscar joined forces after an IRL MotusDAO event. Inspired by the “regenassance,” they envisioned aligning Bancambio and MotusDAO’s ideas to contribute to the global shift towards regenerative economies. The first steps included applying to Gitcoin’s #GG17 round and hosting IRL gatherings to cultivate the solarpunk movement in Mexico.

Their aim is to build a robust regenerative framework across Mexico by uniting Web3 technologies with grassroots initiatives.

### **What Makes ReFi Mexico Special**

ReFi Mexico bridges grassroots regeneration and innovative digital frameworks. As a “connection hub,” the node builds collaborations between organic farmers, water harvesting systems, and clean energy solutions, intending to integrate these efforts on-chain. Its unique Impact Market Maker project is pioneering secure funding for impact DAOs in Mexico, gaining traction as a replicable model for other nodes globally.
