ReFi Cape Towns' Firs

## 2023 Highlights

- **Tokenised Impact Economy Hackathon**: Successfully hosted a hackathon that engaged local developers in using Web3 to address local sustainability challenges. Utilized funding from ReFi DAO and Celo to finance the hackathon, in addition to funding raised from private donors in the renewable energy sector and substantial technical support from ixo.
- **Diverse Community Engagement and Events**: Interacted and connected with an incredibly diverse community, both locally in Cape Town and globally. Organized two in-person events featuring founders from the ReFi space, a year-end beach event, and a community service event distributing meals to the homeless.

## 2024 Vision & Plans

- **Extended Partnerships & Collaboration:** Working with [**ixo**](https://twitter.com/ixoworld), [**UNICEF SA**](https://twitter.com/UNICEF_SA), and Green Rising to develop new Impact DAOs and digital measurement, reporting, and verification (dMRV) protocols. These first initiatives are focused on youth-led citizen science for water quality monitoring and creating learning-to-earning pathways with the Youth Marketplace of Africa and UMUZI.
- **Ecological Benefits Framework Integration**: Planning to complement existing impact measurement and verification software built on the ixo software stack by integrating with the Lexicon and the [**Ecological Benefits Framework**](https://blog.refidao.com/refi-ebf-whats-next/).
- **Fostering Community and Transparency**: Aiming for continued open collaboration in a non-competitive, complimentary, decentralized, and transparent manner among ReFi Local Nodes.
