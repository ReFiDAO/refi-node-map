*“Growing up surrounded by Iroko trees inspired my love for nature. Watching them disappear to deforestation and illegal logging compelled me to take action. ReFi Lagos is my answer to this crisis—bridging indigenous wisdom and Web3 tools to regenerate what we’ve lost.”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

Simon Eze founded ReFi Lagos out of a deep connection to his roots in the Niger Delta region, where environmental degradation is a daily reality. Motivated by memories of planting his first tree at age five and witnessing the destruction of Nigeria’s forests, Simon envisioned ReFi Lagos as a node to combat deforestation, promote climate education, and integrate Web3 technology into community-driven solutions.

The node builds on Simon’s prior work with **Ubi Africa** and **Solatrify**, two initiatives providing market access for farmers and sustainable energy solutions—aligning perfectly with ReFi Lagos’ long-term vision of promoting the water-energy-food nexus across Africa.

### **What Makes ReFi Lagos Special**

ReFi Lagos uniquely integrates indigenous knowledge with decentralised tools to address Nigeria’s urgent climate challenges. The node’s innovative projects, such as **Project Osisi**, which connects tree donors to traceable planting events, and **Project AfriLearn**, a climate ambassador training initiative, demonstrate how grassroots efforts can leverage Web3 for transparency and scale.

By combining education, community engagement, and tangible reforestation actions, ReFi Lagos is building a replicable model of localised climate resilience.

## 2024 Highlights

### Tree Planting Initiatives

- **What Happened:** ReFi Lagos organised impactful reforestation events like **Project Olókun** (coastal erosion awareness and tree planting) and **Project Omole** (climate change education and tree planting in schools). Over 200 native trees were planted in various communities.
- **Why It Matters:** These initiatives directly address deforestation and climate challenges while engaging local communities in stewardship, creating a tangible, positive environmental impact.

### Climate Education and Ambassador Training

- **What Happened:** Launched **Project AfriLearn**, which trained over 60 climate ambassadors to lead environmental initiatives and educated over 4,000 students on climate action through partnerships with schools and organisations.
- **Why It Matters:** Education is the cornerstone of lasting change. By empowering ambassadors and students, ReFi Lagos fosters a generation of climate-conscious leaders equipped to tackle local environmental issues.

### Research and Ecosystem Platforms

- **What Happened:** Developed platforms like **Ubi Africa** (connecting indigenous food producers to global markets) and **Project Osisi**, an on-chain system linking tree donors to planting events. Collaborated with **Impact Miner** on decentralised science (DeSci) projects, including a climate research bounty.
- **Why It Matters:** These platforms demonstrate how Web3 tools can enhance transparency, connect stakeholders, and create scalable solutions for reforestation and sustainable agriculture.

### Key Partnerships

- **What Happened:** ReFi Lagos partnered with **Silvi Protocol** (designing tree-planting methodologies), **Solatrify** (researching solar-powered solutions), and **Impact Miner** (promoting DeSci in Africa).
- **Why It Matters:** Partnerships amplify the node’s capacity to deliver impact by pooling resources, sharing expertise, and extending its reach across Africa.

## Vision for 2025

### Scale Tree Planting and Reforestation Projects

- **What’s Coming:** Expand tree planting initiatives through community-driven events, leveraging platforms like **Project Osisi** to onboard more tree donors and participants.
- **Why It Matters:** Scaling reforestation efforts helps combat deforestation, restore ecosystems, and promote carbon removal, addressing one of Nigeria’s most pressing climate challenges.

### Advance Climate Education and Youth Engagement

- **What’s Coming:** Grow the **Project AfriLearn** ambassador program, training more individuals to lead climate action and expand outreach to additional schools and communities.
- **Why It Matters:** Education builds local capacity, ensuring that climate action is sustained and led by those directly affected by environmental challenges.

### Monetize Ecosystem Platforms

- **What’s Coming:** Collaborate with partners to monetise tree-planting events and climate research bounties. Develop revenue streams through partnerships like Silvi Protocol’s tree rewards and Impact Miner’s ecological data monetisation.
- **Why It Matters:** Financial sustainability is critical for scaling operations and ensuring long-term impact. Monetising these platforms creates a self-sustaining model for funding climate action.

### Formalise Governance and Expand Partnerships

- **What’s Coming:** Register ReFi Lagos as an NGO to streamline operations and attract larger funding opportunities. Deepen collaborations with local and international partners to strengthen the node’s ecosystem.
- **Why It Matters:** A formal structure ensures transparency, accountability, and scalability, while stronger partnerships unlock new opportunities for growth and impact.
