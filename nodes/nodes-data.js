Through shared ownership and purpose, we aim to regenerate not just nature, but trust, opportunity, and agency.”*\n\n### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**\n\nNestled in the heart of The Hague—renowned for its role as a city of justice and peace—ReFi The Hague emerged with a mission to channel the city’s ethos toward environmental and community regeneration. Co-founder Vincent Adrichem had long been involved in nature preservation through his NGO, Viable Community. Witnessing the potential of Web3 tools to foster transparency, community empowerment, and regenerative impact, Vincent saw an opportunity to merge these worlds. The result was ReFi The Hague—a node dedicated to empowering local communities to co-create a sustainable, regenerative future using cutting-edge tools like blockchain technology and decentralized governance.\n\nThe node’s journey began in 2024 with small steps: hosting workshops for local youth, building foundational tools, and connecting with a growing network of volunteers.
