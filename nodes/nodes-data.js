Through shared ownership and purpose, we aim to regenerate not just nature, but trust, opportunity, and agency.\u201d*\n\n### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**\n\nNestled in the heart of The Hague\u2014renowned for its role as a city of justice and peace\u2014ReFi The Hague emerged with a mission to channel the city\u2019s ethos toward environmental and community regeneration. Co-founder Vincent Adrichem had long been involved in nature preservation through his NGO, Viable Community. Witnessing the potential of Web3 tools to foster transparency, community empowerment, and regenerative impact, Vincent saw an opportunity to merge these worlds. The result was ReFi The Hague\u2014a node dedicated to empowering local communities to co-create a sustainable, regenerative future using cutting-edge tools like blockchain technology and decentralized governance.\n\nThe node\u2019s journey began in 2024 with small steps: hosting workshops for local youth, building foundational tools, and connecting with a growing network of volunteers. Every effort has been driven by a simple yet profound belief: that regeneration begins at the grassroots, where people can actively shape and own the solutions to their challenges.\n\n### **What Makes ReFi the Hague Special**\n\nReFi The Hague stands out for its fusion of technological innovation and community-driven purpose. The city\u2019s reputation as a hub for global justice and its rich diversity of residents create fertile ground for a truly inclusive approach to regeneration. The node bridges global regenerative finance concepts with local needs, focusing on creating accessible, user-friendly tools like its upcoming **community marketplace and token system**. What makes ReFi The Hague unique is its commitment to co-ownership\u2014empowering every participant to take an active role in regenerating their environment, fostering both individual and collective responsibility.\n\n![1717151072633.jpeg](nodes/refi-the-hague/images/cover.jpeg)\n\n## 2024 Highlights\n\n### Educational Workshops\n\n- **What happened:** ReFi The Hague organized its first **\u201cIntro to Web3\u201d** workshop in Nigeria, introducing 27 participants (ages 14-24) to blockchain concepts and helping them set up wallets. POAPs were minted to commemorate the event.\n- **Why it matters:** The workshop is a foundational step in equipping the next generation with the skills and knowledge to actively participate in the ReFi movement. By focusing on youth, the node ensures a sustainable pipeline of contributors and advocates for its mission.\n\n### Development of Community Marketplace & Token MVP\n\n- **What happened:** The node advanced its **community marketplace and token system**, preparing both for a testing phase in early 2025.\n- **Why it matters:** These tools will enable the local exchange of goods and services, with the token acting as a stake in co-owned projects. This builds a decentralized economy rooted in trust and accountability while empowering individuals to take direct ownership of regenerative efforts.\n\n### Volunteer Engagement Through Partnerships\n\n- **What happened:** ReFi The Hague leveraged **VolunteerTheHague**, attracting a dedicated team of contributors to support its development work.\n- **Why it matters:** A robust volunteer network is critical for scaling the node\u2019s activities. By partnering with local platforms, the node taps into a pool of engaged individuals who bring diverse skills and perspectives.\n\n## Vision for 2025\n\n### Launch of Fully Operational Marketplace and Token\n\n- **What\u2019s coming:** The node plans to launch its **community marketplace and token system**, enabling seamless exchanges and providing participants with decision-making power in co-owned projects.\n- **Why it matters:** This marks a significant step toward a decentralized, regenerative economy in The Hague. By empowering individuals to co-own and co-govern local projects, the marketplace fosters long-term sustainability and community resilience.\n\n### Expanded Educational Programs\n\n- **What\u2019s coming:** ReFi The Hague will host additional workshops and educational events, focusing on practical applications of Web3 tools for regeneration.\n- **Why it matters:** Education is the cornerstone of empowerment. These programs will equip more community members with the skills to participate in and benefit from the node\u2019s initiatives, ensuring widespread adoption and impact.\n\n### Strengthened Governance and Partnerships\n\n- **What\u2019s coming:** The node aims to establish its own legal foundation, separate from Viable Community, and secure partnerships with local and EU grant programs.\n- **Why it matters:** A dedicated legal entity will enhance transparency, attract funding, and solidify the node\u2019s presence as a trusted community partner. Strategic partnerships will amplify its capacity to deliver impactful projects.\n\n![1730291238867.jpeg](nodes/refi-the-hague/images/refi-the-hague1.jpeg)\n\n![IMG_1054~2.JPG](nodes/refi-the-hague/images/refi-the-hague2.jpg)",

Growing up with a deep appreciation for community and nature, he envisioned a local node that could plant the seed for change\u2014not only in how money is produced but in how it can regenerate the environment and empower communities.

Piloting a community currency fosters financial inclusion and builds resilience against economic shocks.\n\n## Vision for 2025\n\n### Expanding Waste Management to 100+ Tons\n\n- **What\u2019s Coming:** Building on the success of the waste management pilot, ReFi Tanzania aims to offset 100+ tons of waste, leveraging advanced tools like AI and remote sensing for automation.\n- **Why It Matters:** This scale-up will not only have a profound environmental impact but also create more opportunities for waste pickers, demonstrating the scalability of regenerative finance solutions in urban settings.\n\n### Highlighting Local Regenerative Initiatives\n\n- **What\u2019s Coming:** ReFi Tanzania plans to spotlight and support overlooked regenerative projects, such as Nagla\u2019s coconut shell charcoal production and DIY wind farming.\n- **Why It Matters:** By amplifying these initiatives, the node can attract funding and inspire other local innovators to adopt regenerative practices. It also strengthens the narrative of locally-driven, sustainable development.\n\n### Building a Transparent DAO for Community Funding\n\n- **What\u2019s Coming:** ReFi Tanzania aims to fully integrate DAO-based governance into all its projects, ensuring community participation in decision-making and resource allocation.\n- **Why It Matters:** Transparent, decentralized governance fosters trust and efficiency, enabling the node to scale its operations while staying true to its community-first ethos.\n\n![GMU_DmlWcAA8AJF.jpeg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania3.jpeg)\n\n![women ldpe.jpg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania8.jpg)\n\n![GOaaOXaWUAAOMt_.jpeg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania5.jpeg)\n\n![GL_oNpgXsAAG7ez.jpeg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania2.jpeg)\n\n![GMU_L2VW4AAjNzP.jpeg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania4.jpeg)\n\n![IMAGE-2024-08-02-16-07-51.jpg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania6.jpg)\n\n![merimeri point.jpg](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania7.jpg)\n\n![dApp userflow copy.png](nodes/refi-tanzania/images/refi-tanzania1.png)",
