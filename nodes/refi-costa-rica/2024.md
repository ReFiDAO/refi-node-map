*“By bridging crypto philanthropy with grassroots activism, we’re cultivating a homegrown network that channels Web3 tools straight into the hands of local changemakers”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

Two years ago, inspired by the Commons Stack’s Commons Prize, the founders realized Costa Rica’s diverse Web3 communities could achieve more together than apart. By uniting eco-activists, technologists, and rural leaders, they formed ReFi Costa Rica to channel regenerative finance into the country’s social and ecological fabric.

### **What Makes ReFi Costa Rica Special**
