    > "In 2023, the vibrant web3 and ReFi community of Costa Rica connected and collaborated through our events and initiatives, including the first ReFi Incubator experiment. In 2024, we commit to continuing to be the bridge of connection, consolidating Costa Rica as a laboratory of innovation for the tokenization of real assets. From precious wood trees to sustainable real estate, wildlife conservation, and the transformation of traditional industries such as gourmet coffee, rural tourism, wellness, and health, we will support ReFi projects that are exploring new frontiers with web3 tools." - Karla Cordoba Brenes
