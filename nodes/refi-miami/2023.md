## 2023 Highlights

- **Climate Collabothon**: Initiated around Earth Day, involving subject matter experts, influencers, politicians, and government personnel. Focused on sustainability targets for cities and engaged the community in a week-long collaborative hackathon with festival workshops, agroforestry planting actions, and incubator-related gatherings.
- **Urban Reforestation Program**: Introduced an urban reforestation program in early stages, coordinated with key players like DERM (the Department of Environment Resource Management) and Fairchild. Aimed at launching citizen-led urban forestry, with methodologies developed around native and indigenous tree species of the Miami area.
- **Onboarding Web3 and Crypto Community**: Engaged the local community into Web3, with members involved in significant events and organizations like Logos Capital, [**SaveMiami.org**](https://savemiami.org/) and BitBasel.
- **Regional Development & Collaboration**: Miami and South Florida were [**designated as a National Tech Hub for Resilience and Climate**](https://www.miamidade.gov/global/release.page?Mduid_release=rel1698026178244729) and key ReFi Miami members and have served on boards from Miami Dade County and City of Miami to help lead this charge.

## 2024 Vision & Plans

- **Focus on Reforestation**: Continuing partnerships with local festivals for event-based planting and onboarding key stakeholders, for example, Climate Hub. Scaling citizen-led reforestation to plant thousands of trees, contributing to scientific research on local tree species.
- **Corporate Buy-In and Private Sector Participation**: Aiming for solutions that involve not just crypto experimentation but also engage corporate or private sector participants.
- **Collaboration Among Nodes**: Encouraging nodes to collaborate on replicable models and architectures for solutions, with reforestation as a prime example.

> “A lot of solutions are local solutions, but the models and the architecture of these solutions can be replicated in different parts of the world. So it's about creating pillars or verticals for multiple nodes to come together in co-creating and problem-solving.” - Djimo Serodio
