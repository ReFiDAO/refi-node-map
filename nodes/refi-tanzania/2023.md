## 2023 Highlights

- **Variety of Events with Stakeholder Engagement**: Organized three in-person ReFi events sponsored by [**Celo**](https://celo.org/), [**Climate Collective**](https://climatecollective.org/), and ReFi DAO, and one hybrid event in collaboration with The University of Dar-es-Salaam. This partnership is part of an ongoing initiative to demonstrate the use of blockchain technology in sustainability.
- **Launch of Carbon-Backed NFT Marketplace with [CHATAFISHA](https://twitter.com/Chatafisha)**: Implemented an MVP for a marketplace that demonstrates proof of impact in regeneration, beginning with waste management. This initiative has offset over a ton of plastic waste and positively impacted 20 waste pickers in three congested areas managed by four waste managers.
- **Introduction of Community-Backed Currency NYOTA Coin**: Launched the first Community-Backed Currency, NYOTA coin, in Dar-es-Salaam, representing an innovative approach to local economic empowerment.

## 2024 Vision & Plans

- **Use of Community Inclusive Currencies**: Experimenting with community-inclusive currencies in marginalized regions in Tanzania, with the NYOTA community token already launched in Mburahati, Dar es Salaam.
- **Robust Product Management and Exploration of New Fields**: Aiming to successfully execute a comprehensive product management strategy, delve deeper into Pyrolysis and reforestation, and develop a permissionless methodology applicable globally, especially in the global south.
