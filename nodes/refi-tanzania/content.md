*“When regeneration becomes culture, we turn challenges into opportunities and communities into changemakers.”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

ReFi Tanzania was founded in 2022 with a bold vision: to address Dar es Salaam’s urban challenges by blending regenerative finance with community-driven solutions. It began with a small but passionate team drawn together by a shared desire to make an impact. Inspired by the unsung heroes of waste management—waste pickers—the team set out to support their efforts while improving the livelihoods of underserved communities.

From empowering local creatives to building better waste collection systems, ReFi Tanzania has been a testament to the power of decentralized collaboration. Their goal: to create scalable, regenerative solutions that not only tackle environmental issues but also enhance economic resilience.

### **What Makes ReFi Tanzania Special**

ReFi Tanzania stands out for its focus on urban regeneration, creative empowerment, and financial inclusion. By working directly with waste pickers, cooperatives, and creatives, the node bridges the gap between grassroots action and global innovation. Using tools like DAO DAO, it brings transparency to its funding and decision-making processes, ensuring community-driven governance.

Its emphasis on blending local culture with Web3 tools, such as community currencies and decentralized governance, showcases how technology can amplify the impact of on-the-ground efforts. ReFi Tanzania’s work is deeply localized, tackling pressing issues in Dar es Salaam while laying the groundwork for broader applications across Tanzania.

## 2024 Highlights

### Scaling Waste Management Projects

- **What Happened:** ReFi Tanzania completed a pilot that verified 16 tons of plastic waste and aims to scale this initiative to 50 tons. This involved engaging waste pickers, using a data collection app, and creating a DAO-governed funding model.
- **Why It Matters:** By addressing Dar es Salaam’s pressing waste crisis, this initiative not only cleans up the environment but also uplifts waste pickers, who play a critical yet underappreciated role. Scaling the project strengthens the city’s waste management infrastructure and sets an example for other urban areas.

### Creative Empowerment with Web3 Tools

- **What Happened:** Local creatives were onboarded to Web3 tools, allowing them to access global markets, receive fair compensation, and enhance their creative processes. This was part of a larger effort to bridge technological innovation with the creative economy.
- **Why It Matters:** By integrating technology into the creative sector, ReFi Tanzania fosters innovation and economic empowerment. Creatives gain access to broader opportunities while showcasing how Web3 can support cultural and economic development.

### Monthly Beach Cleanups and Community Engagement

- **What Happened:** ReFi Tanzania collaborated with local groups like Six Region to organize monthly beach cleanups in areas like Mbezi Chini. They expanded this initiative by engaging neighborhoods to participate in a “Safi Day”—a monthly cleaning culture.
