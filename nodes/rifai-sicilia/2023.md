> “Rifai Sicilia empowers communities to participate in on-chain regenerative finance and catalyzes a bioregional economy by connecting people, projects, and places. Rifai Sicilia is a cultural interpretation of Regenerative Finance “ReFi”. Rifai in Italian means “Do Over”, offering a new path for cultural and ecological regeneration.” - Antonio Paglino

- **Technological Innovation:** Adopted the dMRV platform Silvi Protocol for ecological monitoring and partnered with Sunflower Ecotech to create an agroforestry ecocredit system.
- **Educational Outreach:** Developed and disseminated Italian language resources on regenerative finance and permaculture and conducted online bioregional mapping sessions.

## 2024 Vision & Plans

- **Educational and Ecological Development**: Developing the school at Butterfly Hill for land restoration and implementing Permaculture strategies like soil regeneration and renewable energy. Boosting bioregional regeneration with seed funding for local projects focusing on watershed restoration, reforestation, and fire prevention.
- **Community and Digital Empowerment:** Formalizing operations with a non-profit association and enhancing the Online Marketplace for Farmers. Upgrade the [**rifaisicilia.com**](https://www.rifaisicilia.com/) website and extend Web3 education in Italian and English.
- **Project Expansion & Rifai Sicilia Week:** Developing eco-credits, create an Italian encyclopedia on regenerative finance, and organize permaculture workshops, beach cleanups, and guardianship initiatives against fires. Showcasing projects and partnerships with a week-long mutual aid event, educational sessions, and bioregional tours.
- **Collaborative Partnerships and Network Growth:** Forging alliances with blockchain communities like ETH Rome, Spaghetti.eth, and Bologna.eth. Spawning more local communities such as ReFi Puglia, ReFi Bologna, and hopefully ReFi Rome, to strengthen the network and regional impact.

> "We came together and did the thing! This was one of the first events where it really felt like we made a tangible impact, actually regenerating land instead of coming together to talk about it! It was also a catalyst for refining our Agroforestry Stewardship Methodology. Definitely a highlight of the year." - Sev Nightingale
