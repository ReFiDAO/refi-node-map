*“Even in Tulum’s transient flow, we are planting seeds of regeneration—one ride, one event, one connection at a time”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

ReFi Tulum sprouted from conversations between Sandra Ponce de Leon and John Daas, driven by their shared belief in the regenerative finance movement and inspired by the possibilities of Gitcoin’s funding ecosystem. As Tulum’s vibrant energy draws a mix of locals, digital nomads, and travellers, Sandra saw an opportunity to embed ReFi into the heart of this eco-conscious but transient community.

Her mission was clear: create practical, locally driven regenerative projects while amplifying the visibility of women and underrepresented voices in the ReFi movement.

### **What Makes ReFi Tulum Special**

Tulum’s unique ecosystem of natural beauty, sustainability-minded locals, and global travellers makes it an ideal testing ground for innovative, place-based regeneration models. What sets ReFi Tulum apart is its commitment to combining **community action with visibility**: creating tangible, on-the-ground solutions like **ReFi Rides**, while also championing the **Fierce Feminine of ReFi** at global events.

Despite the challenges of a transient population and stretched resources, ReFi Tulum is proof that even small nodes can drive meaningful impact—connecting local actions to a global movement.
