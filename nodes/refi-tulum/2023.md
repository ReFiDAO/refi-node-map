**ReFi Tulum**

## 2023 Highlights

- **Advancement in Circular Economy**: Focused on progressing the circular economy with a key focus on using technology to accelerate solutions for plastic sequestration, tracking and tracing on the blockchain, and implementing plastic neutrality programs with various partners.
- **Impactful Partnerships**: Formed crucial collaborations with [**PetGas**](https://twitter.com/petgasmx) and [**Tulum Circula**](https://www.tulumcircula.com.mx/), significantly driving our circularity program forward. The acquisition of TF100 Machine marked a major milestone in enhancing local upcycling capabilities—transforming plastic into usable products, integral to our circular economy strategy. Also, introduced reward systems to integrate Web3 into environmental efforts, with plans to expand towards full-time operation funding. Collaborated with several organizations to reduce their plastic footprint such as, [**Bye Bye Plastic**](https://twitter.com/byebyeplastic) / [**blond:ish**](https://www.instagram.com/blondish/), and Zamna.

## 2024 Vision & Plans

- **Acceleration and Acquisition of Technological Solutions for Tulum**: Our dream of a clean Tulum means creating and accelerating funding mechanisms for core technological solutions to address planetary issues such as plastic waste and environmental contamination. Through our work to bring visibility and awareness to Petgas' patented plastic sequestration technology, our goal is to bring a Petgas plant to Tulum in 2024 to support the work towards a clean Tulum and thus show the world what is possible.
- **Demonstrable Community Benefits**: We will continue to onboard our community to web3 through rewards, incentivization, ecosystem development, and community engagement. We have been putting the pieces in place and are looking forward to connecting the dots so that anyone taking a positive action for Tulum will be rewarded with coins that can be used at local establishments with locally sourced and regenerative practices, thus creating a new economic system based on public good and environmental stewardship.
- **Launch of ReFi Rides for Sustainable Transportation**: Introducing the ReFi Rides project, which offers electric bikes accessible through NFTs, demonstrating a commitment to sustainable transportation as part of a larger goal to weave Web3 solutions into everyday life.
