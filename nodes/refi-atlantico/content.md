*“Our community and environment come first; money follows when we work with purpose and care.”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

ReFi Atlántico was born from Luis Alfonso’s desire to transform how people think about finances. Growing up with a deep appreciation for community and nature, he envisioned a local node that could plant the seed for change—not only in how money is produced but in how it can regenerate the environment and empower communities. Supported by ReFi Colombia’s network, ReFi Atlántico launched to bring the ideals of regenerative finance to the vibrant Atlántico region.

### **What Makes ReFi Atlántico Special**

With its rich cultural and natural diversity, the Atlántico region provides the perfect backdrop for ReFi Atlántico’s work. The node seamlessly blends global ReFi ideals with local realities by organizing beach cleanups, interactive workshops, and tech-centric events that invite the entire community to participate. Through creative partnerships—such as those with Prezenti Grants and ReFi Colombia—ReFi Atlántico stays laser-focused on both environmental preservation and the well-being of its people.
