*“We envision a community-owned economy where every contribution counts, every voice matters, and everyone has the tools to make a difference. Through shared ownership and purpose, we aim to regenerate not just nature, but trust, opportunity, and agency.”*

### **Founding Story & Key Motivations**

Nestled in the heart of The Hague—renowned for its role as a city of justice and peace—ReFi The Hague emerged with a mission to channel the city’s ethos toward environmental and community regeneration. Co-founder Vincent Adrichem had long been involved in nature preservation through his NGO, Viable Community. Witnessing the potential of Web3 tools to foster transparency, community empowerment, and regenerative impact, Vincent saw an opportunity to merge these worlds. The result was ReFi The Hague—a node dedicated to empowering local communities to co-create a sustainable, regenerative future using cutting-edge tools like blockchain technology and decentralized governance.

The node’s journey began in 2024 with small steps: hosting workshops for local youth, building foundational tools, and connecting with a growing network of volunteers. Every effort has been driven by a simple yet profound belief: that regeneration begins at the grassroots, where people can actively shape and own the solutions to their challenges.

### **What Makes ReFi the Hague Special**

ReFi The Hague stands out for its fusion of technological innovation and community-driven purpose. The city’s reputation as a hub for global justice and its rich diversity of residents create fertile ground for a truly inclusive approach to regeneration. The node bridges global regenerative finance concepts with local needs, focusing on creating accessible, user-friendly tools like its upcoming **community marketplace and token system**. What makes ReFi The Hague unique is its commitment to co-ownership—empowering every participant to take an active role in regenerating their environment, fostering both individual and collective responsibility.
